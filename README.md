## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project i learned about the how to use the CSS Grid, however i knew about it, but use it for the first time in any project.

### Continued development

I found CSS grid to be really amazing and it's like a magic to create the layouts. I am going to use this in my every layout based project. However I have not so much practice with grids, so I will practice it.

### Useful resources

- [A complete guide to CSS grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me for learning the CSS grid in an easy way. I really liked this, found it very useful and  I will use it going forward.
